        <h2>Initial Engagement & User Behavior</h2>

        <h3>
          What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
          the experience?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The first thing that caught my eye was the bright colours and the
          glitchy pixelated animations as they drew my attention immediately.
          They set the digital/artsy tone of the website right away. I also
          noticed the short length of the website in general.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
          your discrete actions.
        </h3>
        <p> 
        <ul>
          <li>Scrolled down to explore the rest of the page</li>
          <li>Hovered over text to identify interactive elements</li>
          <li>
            Tried to locate a menu or clickable navigation to continue my
            experience
          </li>
          <li>
            Couldn't find any further links so scrolled back up and interacted
            with animations
          </li>
          <li>Ended up clicking on their linkedin page</li>
        </ul>
    </p> 
<h3>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
</h3>
<p> The last section where the words change when you hover over them 
    Most of my time was spent observing the homepages main visual effects and trying to interpret its meaning or interactivity as it is both attention grabbing and reveals different functions. 
    </p>
<h3>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>

<p>Hovering and scrolling were my most frequent actions. The site encourages you to explore visually, with elements reacting to your cursor movements and page position over clicking or navigation through traditional types of menus.</p>

        <h2>Purpose & Design Communication</h2>
        <h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
        <p>
          
The main goal seems to be showcasing the designers creative identity and technical skills in a memorable, artistic way. They present their portfolio as an immersive art experience rather than a standard resume-style website. My impression is that this artist wants to effectively communicate how they are unique and gifted in design by using as few traditional elements as possible. The artists are very passionate and creative in their expressions and I like the unconventional approach. 

        </p>
        <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
        <p>
            It uses experimental visuals, motion effects, and layered text to establish a strong aesthetic. Theres minimal structure or instruction, signaling that the site is more about visual exploration and less about functional navigation.
        </p>


      </div>

      <div id="box3"> 
        <h2> User experience over time</h2>
        <h3>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
        </h3>
       <p>
        It is short and sweet and feels like the short-form experience is meant to impress in one or two visits or under 5 minutes. Its not designed for repeated, long-term engagement, but rather to leave a lasting impression quickly, like a digital art installation.
        </p>
        <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
<p>
    The website uses its minimal structure and artistic presentation to suggest that its meant for short, impactful visits rather than repeated long-term use. The lack of traditional navigation or evolving content signals that the site is more like a digital art experience. The design promotes brief exploration time and incentives for getting in contact with the artist. 
    </p>

      <div id="box4">
        <h2>Interpretation & References </h2>
        <h3>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
        <p>
            The website features the use of advanced web technologies and visual effects such as the pixel displacement effect, these references creates a dynamic and interactive visual for the user and highlight the use of advanced web technologies commonly used in contemporary digital media.​
        </p>
        <h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
        <p>
            The emphasis on visual effects and contemporary web technologies suggests that users are encouraged to engage with the website in an exploratory and interactive manner. It implies that the research experience is not just about passive information but also about actively interacting with the visual and functional elements of the site to fully appreciate the designer's capabilities and artistic vision.
        </p>
        <h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
        <p>The use of sophisticated design techniques aims to evoke a sense of innovation and creativity. Users might feel intrigued and inspired by the artistic presentation, leaving an appreciation for the mix of art, design and technology used.</p>

        <h2>Emotional & Functional Response</h2>
        <h3>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>
      <p>I love the concept of this website but felt a little underwhelmed with what you can gain from it. 
        The most frustrating part is the site's lack of functional navigation and clarity. The visual effects are captivating, but there's minimal guidance or labeling, making it hard to tell where to click or what content is interactive. This creates confusion and interrupts the flow of exploration, especially for users unfamiliar with artistic web layouts –  I wish there were just a little more external links to navigate to on top of the beautiful visuals.
        </p>
        <h3>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>
    <p>The most satisfying part is the bold visual identity and the artistic commitment to web design. The pixel and layered textual effects communicate passion and creativity. I enjoyed finding little easter eggs throughout my experience. It feels like stepping into a digital art piece, not just a portfolio and reinforces the designer’s philosophy leaving a strong emotional impression.
