      Interactive Media 1 is about enabling you to engage with the fundamentals
      of interaction design through the use of web programming. Our focus will
      be on building up from the basic principles of programming, covering the
      standard web languages - HTML, CSS and JavaScript, in order to be able to
      select and use appropriate programming languages, together with core
      concepts of interaction design, in service of your broader digital design
      goals.
